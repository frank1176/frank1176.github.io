        Overwatch is a multiplayer team-based first-person shooter developed and
        published by Blizzard Entertainment.

        <br /><br />In a time of global crisis, an international task force of
        heroes banded together to restore peace to a war-torn world. This
        organization, known as Overwatch, ended the crisis and helped maintain
        peace for a generation, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and
        discovery. After many years, Overwatch's influence waned and it was
        eventually disbanded. Now in the wake of its dismantling, conflict is
        rising once again. Overwatch may be gone... but the world still needs
        heroes.

        At the 2016 BlizzCon, Blizzard announced their plans for their Overwatch
        League, using an organization of permanent teams in league placements
        similar to more traditional North American professional sports
        leagues,rather than the use of promotion and relegation used in a series
        like League of Legends Championship Series

        The first season of the League started in January 2018, with teams vying
        for a US$one million League winner prize, alongside other winnings from
        a total prize pool of US$3.5 million. The second season brought in an
        additional eight franchise for a total of twenty. <br /><br />In the
        first and second season, nearly all games outside the finals were played
        at Blizzard Arena in Burbank, California, while the third season will
        see teams traveling between homestand events across the globe, as is
        more traditional of league structures
