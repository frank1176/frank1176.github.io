      <h1>What is First Person Shooter?</h1>
      <p>
        First person-shooter games are also often categorized as being distinct
        from light gun shooters, a similar genre with a first-person perspective
        which use light gun peripherals, in contrast to first-person shooters
        which use conventional input devices for movement. Another difference is
        that first-person light-gun shooters like Virtua Cop often feature
        "on-rails" (scripted) movement, whereas first-person shooters like Doom
        give the player more freedom to roam.

        <p>
          My favorite game mode is first-person shooting. The first time I
          played a first-person shooter game was when I was 8 years old playing
          Counter-Strike 1.6 game. Then I enjoyed playing against friends or
          enemy teams.

          In 2016, Blizzard Entertainment announced that the new game name is
          Overwatch. This new game features first-person shooting and online
          competition. <br /><br />
          Overwatch Competitive Play is the largest change Blizzard has made to
          their massively popular first-person shooter since its May release.
          The stated goal of this addition has been to create a game mode with a
          more intense tempo for hardcore Overwatch gamers. Serious players can
          hone their skills in tight battles against players of equal measure
          and slowly gain ranks.
