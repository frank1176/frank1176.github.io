        The first of the three heroines, Saber is an agile and powerful warrior
        who retains her identity, hence her substitute name after her role as a
        member of the Saber class. She also serves as the route's servant
        protagonist. She was the victor of the Fourth Holy Grail War with
        another Master and claims to be the strongest out of all Servants in the
        Saber Class.<br />
        <br />
        As Kotomine aims to use Illya's body to recreate the Holy Grail, Shirou
        and Saber confront him and his servant Gilgamesh. Following Shirou's and
        Saber's victories, Shirou orders Saber to destroy the Grail. This causes
        Saber to go back to her last moments before her death. In the RÃ©alta Nua
        version of the game, a new ending can be unlocked where Shirou becomes a
        heroic spirit in order to meet Saber in the afterlife of heroes, Avalon.

      <p>
        The second of the three heroines is Rin Tohsaka, a model student and
        idol of Shirou's school who is secretly a mage and Master of Archer in
        the Holy Grail War. Her servant Archer serves as the servant protagonist
        of the route. She descends from a long, distinguished line of mages, and
        though she lacks a formal magic education, she is extremely powerful and
        gifted in her own right. Rin is dubbed "The Ice Queen" by classmates for
        her cold, unreachable, persona at school; however, this is simply a
        front to hide her true status as a mage. <br />
        <br />
        During the story, Shirou loses control of Saber but instead aims to
        fight with his magical strength to stop the war. Archer betrays Rin and
        reveals his despondency and bitterness over his past choices to Shirou.
        He subsequently challenges Shirou to a fight, hoping to destroy his
        story of being a hero. However, Shirou accepts his future regardless of
        the regrets and misery, deciding to stick to Kiritsugu's ideals.
        <br /><br />
        Gilgamesh tries to kill Archer and Shirou, with the former seemingly
        sacrificing himself to protect the latter. To follow Archer's hopes, Rin
        passes Shirou her mana to fight Gilgamesh to replicate Archer's powers.
        As Shirou nearly kills Gilgamesh, Archer uses his last strength to
        deliver the final attack at their enemy while assisting Saber to destroy
        the Holy Grail. In the True Ending, Shirou and Rin move to London to
        study magic, as well as start a romantic relationship.

        The third and final heroine is Sakura Matou, a first-year high school
        student and long-time friend of Shirou's, who often visits his home to
        help him with his daily chores. A quiet, soft-spoken girl, Sakura can be
        surprisingly stubborn at times and holds a deep, unparalleled affection
        for Shirou. She is revealed to be Rin's long-lost sister, who was raised
        by the Matou family and has since suffered their abuse while in training
        as a magus. Sakura is also discovered as the true master of Rider, who
        she reasserts control of from Shinji, making Rider the servant
        protagonist of the route.<br />
        <br />
        In the route, Saber and Berserker are consumed by the shadows of Angra
        Manyu, and in the ensuing battle with True Assassin and the corrupted
        servants, a mortally wounded Archer transplants his left arm to save a
        dying Shirou. Zouken, Sakura's grandfather, places a shard of the lesser
        grail from the 4th Holy Grail War in her body, infecting Sakura with
        Angra Manyu.
