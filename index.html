          Her father was the bassist of a band, so Aimer grew up surrounded by
          music from a very young age. She began studying the piano in
          elementary school and highly looked up to Ringo Sheena and Utada
          Hikaru. In junior high school, listening to Avril Lavigne inspired her
          to take up guitar and began writing English lyrics. At the age of 15,
          Aimer lost her voice due to over-usage of her vocal cords and was
          forced to undergo silence therapy for treatment. However, that did not
          stop her, and after she recovered, she acquired her distinctive husky
          voice.

          First-person shooter (FPS) is a video game genre centered on gun and
          other weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective; that is, the
          player experiences the action through the eyes of the protagonist. The
          genre shares common traits with other shooter games, which in turn
          makes it fall under the heading action game. Since the genre's
          inception, advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware
          development, and multiplayer gaming has been integral.

          Fate/stay night, and Fate/hollow ataraxia are directly related, taking
          place in the same universe. The prequel work "Fate/Zero", while
          telling the story of the Fourth Holy Grail War 10 years prior to
          Fate/stay night, is treated as taking place in a very similar parallel
          world due to various differences in minor details and events.
          Fate/kaleid liner PRISMAâ˜†ILLYA is a direct spin-off of Fate/stay night
          featuring characters from Fate/stay night, Fate/hollow ataraxia and
          Fate/Zero in a parallel world where the Fourth Holy Grail War was
          stopped before taking place.
