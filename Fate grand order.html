          In 2015, the Chaldea Security Organization draws on experts of both
          the magical and mundane fields to observe the future of mankind for
          possible extinction events. Humanity's survival seems assured for the
          next century—until the verdict suddenly changes, and now eradication
          of the species awaits at the end of 2016. The cause is unknown, but
          appears to be linked with the Japanese town of Fuyuki and the events
          of 2004 during the Fifth Holy Grail War.

          The Lostbelts (in Japanese: 異聞帯) are supernatural alternate
          dimensions and the main setting of Fate/Grand Order: Cosmos in the
          Lostbelt.<br />
          <br />
          The Lostbelts are considered by the world itself to be failed
          timelines. As opposed to the Greater History of Man, the history of
          "winners" born from correct choices and proper prosperities leading to
          the "present", the Lostbelts are histories of "failure" born from the
          wrong choices or false prosperity for humanity. Such is their nature
          of failure that they are even cut off from the greater multiverse.<br />
          <br />
          The Lostbelts started to surface and establish themselves on earth
          itself after the Crypters allied with the Outer Gods and instigated an
          attack against Chaldea. The Crypters were seven former A-Team Masters
          who died in the attack of Lev Flaros, but was revived by someone
          presumably loyal to the Outer Gods.<br />
